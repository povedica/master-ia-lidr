"""Skeleton for the deterministic ``calculate_estimate`` tool (Session 12).

This is a STARTING POINT so you don't waste time on the cost model and can focus on
the agent loop. It is a pure Python function — NO LLM call. Fill in the TODOs.

Contract (what the agent passes in and expects back):

    calculate_estimate({
        "components": [
            {"name": "Auth backend", "reference_amounts": [420.0, 380.0]},
            {"name": "Mobile app",   "reference_amounts": [780.0, 640.0]},
        ]
    })
    ->
    {
        "components": [
            {"name": "Auth backend", "reference_count": 2, "estimated_hours": ..., "unbudgeted": False},
            ...
        ],
        "total_hours": ...,
        "summary": "...",   # a short human-readable line for the trace observation
    }

The reference solution lives in ``app/services/agentic/agent_tools.py`` — try it
yourself first, then compare.
